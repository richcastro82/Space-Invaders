# Space Invaders

I create the classic space invaders game with the pygame library. I used sound effects and music from https://freesound.org/browse/tags/game-sound/

Here are the exact sound effects used: 
Start Screen Music: https://freesound.org/people/Romariogrande/sounds/396231/
Hero Ship Laser Effect: https://freesound.org/people/Daleonfire/sounds/376694/
Enemy Ship Laser Effect: https://freesound.org/people/Metzik/sounds/459781/
