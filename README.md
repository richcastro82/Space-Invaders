# Space Invaders

I create the classic space invaders game with the pygame library. I used sound effects and music from https://freesound.org/browse/tags/game-sound/

Here are the exact sound effects used: \
Start Screen Music: https://freesound.org/people/Romariogrande/sounds/396231/  \
Hero Ship Laser Effect: https://freesound.org/people/Daleonfire/sounds/376694/  \
Enemy Ship Laser Effect: https://freesound.org/people/Metzik/sounds/459781/  \

This is part of my programming profolio. This game uses a few programming concepts. Classes, methods, functions, randomization, and more. I have commented my code and properly constructed to code convention.
